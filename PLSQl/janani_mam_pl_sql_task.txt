1.create four separate functions to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of two inputs

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ADDITION(A IN NUMBER,B IN NUMBER)
RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
RETURN A+B;
END ADDITION;

SELECT ADDITION(1,2) AS ADDITION FROM DUAL;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION SUBRACTION(A IN NUMBER,B IN NUMBER)
RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
RETURN A-B;
END SUBRACTION;

SELECT SUBRACTION(10,2) AS SUBRACTION FROM DUAL;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION MULTIPLICATION(A IN NUMBER,B IN NUMBER)
RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
RETURN A*B;
END MULTIPLICATION;

SELECT MULTIPLICATION(10,15) AS MULTIPLICATION FROM DUAL;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION DIVISION(A IN NUMBER,B IN NUMBER)
RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
RETURN A/B;
END DIVISION;

SELECT DIVISION(10,5) AS DIVISION FROM DUAL;


2.create a package called as arithmetic by including the above 4 functions
BEGIN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(ADDITION(1,3));
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(SUBRACTION(7,3));
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(MULTIPLICATION(3,9));
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(DIVISION(10,3));
END;

3.call the function in select statement and in anonymous block

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE arithmetic_pkg IS
function ADDITION(A NUMBER,B NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER;
function SUBRACTION(A NUMBER,B NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER;
function MULTIPLICATION(A NUMBER,B NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER;
function DIVISION(A NUMBER,B NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER;
END arithmetic_pkg;

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY arithmetic_pkg IS
FUNCTION ADDITION(A NUMBER , B NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
RETURN A+B;
END ADDITION;
FUNCTION SUBRACTION(A NUMBER , B NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
RETURN A-B;
END SUBRACTION;
FUNCTION MULTIPLICATION(A NUMBER , B NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
RETURN A*B;
END MULTIPLICATION;
FUNCTION DIVISION(A NUMBER , B NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
RETURN A/B;
END DIVISION;
END arithmetic_pkg;

select arithmetic_pkg.ADDITION(1,2) from dual;
select arithmetic_pkg.SUBRACTION(5,3) from dual;
select arithmetic_pkg.MULTIPLICATION(2,3) from dual;
select arithmetic_pkg.DIVISION(10,2) from dual
